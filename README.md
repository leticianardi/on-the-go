# JavaScript: ON THE GO

  ## Description

  Driving as a ride-share driver is hard enough as it is. Finding a restroom in 2021 should be the easy part. Unfortuately, it isn't.
 
  Most businesses, gas stations, grocery, and drug stores keep their facilities locked. There are portables scattered across the city but most are locked after hours. Its an unreliable and time consuming process. **ON THE GO** elimnates the guessing and saves drivers money by identifing locations with an open restroom, updated by users of the app. When a driver is looking for a bathroom, they can find one within the app.

  Future developments will allow users to rate their experience, and confirm it the status of the facilities.
